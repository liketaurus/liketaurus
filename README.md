### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![My GitHub Stat's](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=liketaurus&show_icons=true)

My name is Alexander Babich and I have a years of IT and teaching experience, Ph.D. in Software Engineering, and a lot of professional certifications and statuses. 

I wrote a two book, one of them is using as a student's handbook in a range of local and foreign Universities. 
Also I record two popular video trainings on Java development and SharePoint administration. 

My superpower is *ability to explain everything with simple words* in a plain English (or Russian or Ukrainian).
